        I am an OzGrav Postdoctoral Fellow at Monash University where I primarily work on gravitational-wave population inference and astrostatistics. It's an exciting time in the land of gravitational-waves. Gravitational-wave detectors like [LIGO](https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/) and [Virgo](https://www.virgo-gw.eu/) have reached unprecedented sensitivies. Just within the last ten years, the [number of detected gravitational-wave mergers has surpassed 200](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18082). 


        My research leverages these detections to study astrophysical BBHs and uncovering
        the stellar physics that governs their properties and the environments in which they form. My work lies at the
        interface of astrophysics and data science,  with a particular focus on Bayesian methods for inference.
